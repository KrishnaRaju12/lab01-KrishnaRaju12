This is a documentation string (or docstring). Docstrings are a convenient way of associating documentation with Python
modules, functions, classes, and methods. As this docstring is at the start of our file it is documentation for the
entire module. All of your files (modules) should have a docstring that gives a high level overview of what the module
does.

CSM 2170: P01LandCalculation

One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Complete this program so that it asks the user to enter the total
square feet in a tract of land and calculates the number of acres in the tract. Fractional acres are truncated i.e.
only output the number of whole acres. You may assume the input is a non-negative number. See Chapter 2 Programming
Exercise 3.
