CSM 2170: P02MilesPerGallon

A vehicle's miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
         Miles driven
MPG = -------------------
      Gallons of gas used

Complete this program to ask the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used. It should calculate
the  vehicle's MPG and display the result. Fractional values should be truncated. If the MPG is 42.2 then just return
and display 42. See Chapter 2 Programming Exercise 7.
