CSM 2170: P05CompoundInterest

You are to make a program to calculate compound interest. Your program must ask the user to input:

* The amount of the principle originally deposited as a non-negative float (e.g. 1013.56 for $1013.56 or whatever
  currency the account is in)
* The annual interest rate as a percentage (a float) (e.g. the user would type 3.15 for 3.15% which will need to be converted
  into the decimal .0315 for the calculation)
* The number of times per year the interest is compounded as a positive integer
* The number of years the account will earn interest as a positive integer

Then the program should calculate and display the amount of money that will be in the account after the specified
number of years. See Chapter 2 Programming Exercise 14 for more details and the formula for this type of compound
interest.
