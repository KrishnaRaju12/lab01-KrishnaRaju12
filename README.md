# CSM2170-Lab01

Read and complete the implementations of:
* [P01LandCalculation](P01LandCalculation.py)
* [P02MilesPerGallon](P02MilesPerGallon.py)
* [P03TemperatureConverter](P03TemperatureConverter.py)
* [P04ArrivalTime](P04ArrivalTime.py)
* [P05CompoundInterest](P05CompoundInterest.py)

For this lab you may assume the user will only enter correctly formatted values.

You can run the automated tests with the command:
```
python -m unittest Lab01-tests
```
If your machine has multiple versions of Python on it, you may have to use `python3` rather than `python`. Most IDEs
will also run the test file for you. The automated tests are not meant to be exhaustive, but to give you some confidence
that your code is correct. You should also manually test your code with your own test cases.

Commit your changes often (at least once per program, but likely many more times for larger programs). However, you
should only push when you are done with your work or have code that you want me to comment on. Note that the automated
tests will run when you push as well.

Your code is not only graded by the automated tests. I will run more tests on your code and review your code and
commits. You are expected to follow good programming conventions. Failure to do so will impact your grade for an
assignment. For example, you should:
* use descriptive names and avoid single character names
* make identifiers easy to read (current_value instead of curval)
* follow the [PEP 8 style](https://pep8.org/)
* include comments (lots of comments)
* comments should be meaningful, describe the logic or reason for its code block, and be readable
* include documentation strings for modules (each file) and functions
* use named constants not magic numbers (unnamed constants)
* have messages and prompts that are nicely formatted
* provide information to the user in a consistent and helpful manner
* write good commit messages
* commit early and often
* push less often (e.g. once per day when done with work for the day)
